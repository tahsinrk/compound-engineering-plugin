# Voice Analysis Dimensions

Complete framework for analyzing writing voice across all dimensions.

## 1. Vocabulary Dimensions

### 1.1 Complexity

| Level | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Simple | 8th grade reading level | Short words, common vocabulary |
| Moderate | 10-12th grade | Mix of common and specialized |
| Complex | College+ | Domain expertise, advanced vocabulary |

**How to measure**: Use Flesch-Kincaid or similar readability metric.

### 1.2 Formality

| Level | Indicators |
|-------|------------|
| Casual | Contractions, slang, sentence fragments |
| Conversational | Contractions, no slang, complete sentences |
| Professional | Minimal contractions, industry terms |
| Formal | No contractions, third person, passive voice acceptable |

### 1.3 Technical Density

- **None**: No jargon, fully accessible
- **Light**: Occasional terms, defined or obvious
- **Moderate**: Regular technical vocabulary, assumes baseline
- **Heavy**: Dense specialized language, expert audience

### 1.4 Signature Vocabulary

Look for:
- Words used 3+ times across samples
- Unusual word choices (not the obvious word)
- Branded terms or coined phrases
- Consistent metaphor families

## 2. Sentence Dimensions

### 2.1 Length Metrics

| Metric | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|
| Average length | Total words / total sentences |
| Shortest sentence | Minimum (for emphasis use) |
| Longest sentence | Maximum (complexity tolerance) |
| Variance | How much length varies |

**Typical ranges**:
- Punchy: 8-12 words average
- Balanced: 15-20 words average
- Complex: 25+ words average

### 2.2 Structure Types

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Simple | Subject + Verb | "The code runs." |
| Compound | S+V and/or S+V | "The code runs, and tests pass." |
| Complex | Main clause + dependent | "When you run the code, tests pass." |
| Compound-Complex | Multiple clauses | Full combination |

### 2.3 Opening Patterns

Count percentage of sentences starting with:
- Subject (proper start): "The team decided..."
- Question: "What if we..."
- Transition: "However, the approach..."
- Participle: "Running the tests..."
- Subordinate clause: "When the tests passed..."
- "I" or "We": First person leads

### 2.4 Fragment Usage

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Never | All complete sentences |
| Rare | Emphasis only, <5% |
| Occasional | Stylistic choice, 5-15% |
| Frequent | Part of voice, >15% |

## 3. Paragraph Dimensions

### 3.1 Length Patterns

- **Short**: 1-2 sentences (punchy, scannable)
- **Medium**: 3-4 sentences (standard)
- **Long**: 5+ sentences (dense, academic)

### 3.2 Structure Patterns

**Opening types**:
- Topic sentence (states paragraph purpose)
- Hook (attention-grabbing statement)
- Question (rhetorical or actual)
- Transition (from previous paragraph)

**Closing types**:
- Conclusion (wraps up the point)
- Bridge (sets up next paragraph)
- Punch line (memorable closer)
- Question (leaves reader thinking)

### 3.3 White Space

Visual density of paragraphs:
- Dense: Long paragraphs, few breaks
- Moderate: Mixed lengths
- Airy: Short paragraphs, frequent breaks, lists

## 4. Rhythm Dimensions

### 4.1 Pacing

| Type | Pattern |
|------|---------|
| Staccato | Short, punchy, rapid-fire |
| Legato | Long, flowing, connected |
| Varied | Intentional mix for effect |

### 4.2 Punctuation Profile

For each mark, note frequency:
- **Em dash**: Emphasis, interruption, asides
- **Parentheses**: Secondary info, qualification
- **Semicolon**: Related ideas, sophistication
- **Colon**: Introduction, lists, explanation
- **Ellipsis**: Trailing off, suspense
- **Exclamation**: Energy, emphasis

### 4.3 Repetition Patterns

- **Anaphora**: Repeated beginnings ("We built. We shipped. We learned.")
- **Epistrophe**: Repeated endings
- **Parallelism**: Similar structure across items
- **Rule of three**: Three beats, three examples

## 5. Emotional Dimensions

### 5.1 Tone Categories

| Tone | Indicators |
|------|------------|
| Optimistic | Positive framing, future focus, solutions |
| Skeptical | Questions assumptions, critical analysis |
| Neutral | Balanced, informational, objective |
| Passionate | Strong language, personal investment |
| Urgent | Time pressure, calls to action |
| Calm | Measured, reflective, patient |

### 5.2 Distance Scale

| Level | Indicators |
|-------|------------|
| Intimate | "I", "you", personal stories, vulnerability |
| Conversational | Occasional "you", relatable examples |
| Professional | "We", company voice, limited personal |
| Academic | Third person, citations, objectivity |
| Distant | Passive voice, "one", impersonal |

### 5.3 Stakes Level

How urgent does the writing feel?

- **Low**: Informational, "here's how it works"
- **Medium**: Opinion, "this matters because"
- **High**: Urgent, "you need to act now"

## 6. Structural Dimensions

### 6.1 Organization Patterns

- **Linear**: Point A to Point B to Point C
- **Problem-Solution**: State problem, resolve it
- **Compare-Contrast**: This vs. that
- **Chronological**: Timeline or narrative
- **Spatial**: By location or component
- **Priority**: Most to least important

### 6.2 Argument Style

- **Inductive**: Examples first, principle after
- **Deductive**: Principle first, examples after
- **Dialectical**: Thesis, antithesis, synthesis

### 6.3 Evidence Preferences

- Stories and anecdotes
- Data and statistics
- Expert quotes
- Logical reasoning
- Personal experience
- Historical examples

## Analysis Checklist

For complete voice extraction, analyze:

- [ ] Vocabulary: complexity, formality, technical density, signatures
- [ ] Sentences: length, structure, openings, fragments
- [ ] Paragraphs: length, structure, white space
- [ ] Rhythm: pacing, punctuation, repetition
- [ ] Emotion: tone, distance, stakes
- [ ] Structure: organization, argument style, evidence

## Quick Analysis Framework

For rapid analysis, focus on:

1. **Average sentence length** (objective, measurable)
2. **Formality level** (contractions, word choice)
3. **Primary tone** (one word descriptor)
4. **Signature vocabulary** (3-5 distinctive words)
5. **Paragraph length** (short, medium, long)
