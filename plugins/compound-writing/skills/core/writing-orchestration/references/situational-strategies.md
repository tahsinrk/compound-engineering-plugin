# 20+ Situational Writing Strategies

Select 3-4 strategies based on content type and goals. Don't apply all—choose what fits.

## Hook & Opening Strategies

### hook-effectiveness

**Purpose**: Create openings that demand attention.

**Techniques**:
- **Counterintuitive**: Challenge what readers believe
- **Surprising stat**: Data that defies expectations
- **In media res**: Start in the middle of action
- **Question**: One the reader genuinely wants answered

**Test**: Would you keep reading if you saw this on a busy feed?

### tension-builder

**Purpose**: Create and resolve tension throughout.

**Techniques**:
- Establish stakes early
- Create obstacles before solutions
- Use "but" and "however" strategically
- Delay resolution for impact

**Pattern**: Setup → Complication → Resolution

### pattern-twist

**Purpose**: Set expectations, then break them.

**Techniques**:
- Establish a pattern (three examples)
- Break on the fourth
- Use for humor or insight

**Example**: "We tried ads. We tried SEO. We tried influencers. We tried talking to customers. That last one worked."

## Structure & Flow Strategies

### order-words-emphasis

**Purpose**: Put important words where they land hardest—at the end.

**Techniques**:
- Move key terms to sentence end
- End paragraphs with punch
- Save reveals for last position

**Transform**: "We need to focus on the customer." → "Our focus must be the customer."

### sentence-length

**Purpose**: Vary length for rhythm and impact.

**Guidelines**:
- **Short (1-5 words)**: For impact. Punch. Emphasis.
- **Medium (10-20 words)**: For information and flow.
- **Long (25+ words)**: For building, explaining, setting scenes—but sparingly.

**Pattern**: Mix deliberately. Three medium, one short. Repeat.

### paragraph-length

**Purpose**: Create visual rhythm on the page.

**Guidelines**:
- One sentence paragraphs: For emphasis
- 2-3 sentence paragraphs: Standard
- 4+ sentence paragraphs: Use rarely

Like this.

### ladder-abstraction

**Purpose**: Alternate between concrete and abstract.

**Pattern**:
1. Concrete example
2. Abstract principle
3. Another concrete example
4. Broader implication

**Why**: Concrete grounds understanding. Abstract provides meaning. Neither alone is sufficient.

## Style & Voice Strategies

### elegant-variation

**Purpose**: Avoid awkward word repetition.

**Techniques**:
- Use pronouns strategically
- Find true synonyms (not forced ones)
- Restructure to avoid repetition
- Sometimes, repetition is intentional—for emphasis

**Warning**: Don't substitute "the social media giant" for "Facebook" constantly. That's worse.

### passive-aggressive

**Purpose**: Use passive voice strategically, not accidentally.

**When passive works**:
- Actor is unknown: "The data was compromised"
- Actor is irrelevant: "The study was conducted in 2020"
- Emphasis on object: "The bill was passed" (focus on bill, not Congress)

**Default**: Active voice. Reserve passive for strategic use.

### punctuation-pace

**Purpose**: Use punctuation to control reading rhythm.

**Tools**:
- **Period**: Full stop. Finality. Impact.
- **Comma**: Pause, breath, continuation
- **Em dash**: Interruption—surprise—aside
- **Semicolon**: Connection between related ideas; used sparingly
- **Colon**: Introduction of what follows

**Example**: "We had three options—none of them good."

### key-words-space

**Purpose**: Give important terms room to breathe.

**Techniques**:
- Don't cluster key terms together
- Space important words throughout
- Let each land before introducing the next

**Wrong**: "The efficiency, productivity, and scalability improvements..."
**Right**: "Efficiency improved. So did productivity. Scalability followed."

## Persuasion & Engagement Strategies

### essential-name-filter

**Purpose**: Include only names that add value.

**Test**: Does naming this person/company/product serve the reader?

**Keep**: Names that add credibility, context, or story
**Cut**: Names that are just noise

### name-of-dog

**Purpose**: Specific details create authenticity.

**Technique**: Include the kind of detail only someone who was there would know.

**Examples**:
- "Her golden retriever, Murphy, sat under the desk"
- "The server ran Ubuntu 18.04"
- "The email came at 2:47 AM"

**Why**: Specificity = credibility.

### original-images

**Purpose**: Fresh metaphors over clichés.

**Clichés to kill**:
- "thinking outside the box"
- "at the end of the day"
- "move the needle"
- "low-hanging fruit"
- "on the same page"

**Technique**: If you've heard it before, find a new way to say it.

### show-and-tell

**Purpose**: Balance showing with telling.

**When to show**: Emotional moments, key scenes, character
**When to tell**: Transitions, summaries, facts

**Balance**: Show the important parts. Tell the rest.

## Narrative & Story Strategies

### narrate-scenes

**Purpose**: Create immersive scene-setting.

**Elements**:
- Sensory details (what you see, hear, feel)
- Action in progress
- Dialogue if relevant
- Specific time and place

**Example**: "The office was empty except for Sarah, hunched over her laptop, the glow of Slack notifications reflecting off her glasses."

### cinematic-angles

**Purpose**: Use camera-like perspective shifts.

**Techniques**:
- Wide shot: Establish context, setting
- Medium shot: Character and environment
- Close-up: Detail, emotion, significance
- Pull back: Broader meaning, reflection

**Use for**: Feature articles, profiles, narrative pieces

### dialogue-compression

**Purpose**: Make dialogue tight and purposeful.

**Rules**:
- Cut greetings and small talk
- Each line should advance story or reveal character
- Attribution ("he said") should be minimal
- Use beats (actions) instead of dialogue tags

**Wrong**: "Hi, how are you?" "I'm fine, thanks. How are you?"
**Right**: [Cut entirely unless the pleasantries reveal something]

### reveal-traits

**Purpose**: Show character through action, not description.

**Wrong**: "She was a perfectionist."
**Right**: "She realigned the pens on her desk for the third time."

**Technique**: What would this person DO that shows their trait?
