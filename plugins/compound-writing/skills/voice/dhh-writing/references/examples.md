# DHH Writing Examples

Before/after transformations showing the style in action.

## Example 1: Remote Work

### Before (Corporate)

> At our organization, we have implemented a flexible work arrangement policy that enables team members to work from locations outside the traditional office environment when appropriate and aligned with business needs. We believe this approach supports employee well-being while maintaining operational effectiveness.

### After (DHH Style)

> **We work remotely. Period.**
>
> Not "hybrid." Not "flexible when business needs allow." Remotely.
>
> We've done it for 20 years. Through growth, through recessions, through a pandemic. Our team lives in 32 cities across 8 time zones.
>
> The secret? Trust your people. If you hired adults, treat them like adults.
>
> "But what about collaboration?" We collaborate fine. "But what about culture?" Our culture is stronger than most offices. "But what about—" Stop.
>
> The excuses are endless. The results speak for themselves.

## Example 2: Meetings

### Before (Typical)

> While meetings are an important tool for organizational alignment and cross-functional collaboration, we've found that optimizing meeting cadence and implementing meeting-free focus time can significantly improve individual contributor productivity. We recommend that teams evaluate their current meeting load and consider whether all recurring meetings continue to add value.

### After (DHH Style)

> **Most meetings are a waste of time.**
>
> Not some meetings. Most.
>
> "But we need to align!" Write it down.
>
> "But I need to get buy-in!" Ask via email.
>
> "But decisions are faster in person!" Are they? Or do you just feel busier?
>
> Here's our meeting policy: Don't have one unless you absolutely must. No recurring meetings by default. Every meeting needs an agenda and an end time.
>
> The best meetings are the ones that never happen.

## Example 3: Hiring

### Before (HR-Speak)

> Our talent acquisition strategy focuses on identifying candidates who demonstrate strong cultural fit while possessing the technical competencies required for role success. We utilize a comprehensive evaluation process including behavioral interviews, technical assessments, and reference verification to ensure alignment with organizational values and capabilities.

### After (DHH Style)

> **Stop hiring for "culture fit."**
>
> You know what "culture fit" usually means? "I'd want to get beer with this person." That's not hiring. That's cloning.
>
> We hire for work. Can you do the job? Can you work with others? Can you communicate clearly in writing? That's it.
>
> Your hobbies don't matter. Your pedigree doesn't matter. Stanford? Community college? Self-taught? We don't care. Show us your work.
>
> The best teams aren't full of people who look alike, think alike, or hang out together. They're full of people who do great work. Hire for that.

## Example 4: Pricing

### Before (Startup-Speak)

> We're excited to announce our new pricing tiers, designed to provide options for organizations of all sizes. Our freemium model allows teams to experience our platform's value before committing, while our enterprise tier delivers advanced functionality for larger deployments.

### After (DHH Style)

> **We don't do free. We don't do enterprise.**
>
> One price. For everyone. $99/month. Done.
>
> "But what about small teams?" $99.
>
> "But what about big companies?" $99.
>
> "But what about—" $99.
>
> Why? Because software should work for everyone the same way. Big company features aren't special. They're usually just complexity. And free tiers mean someone else is paying—usually with their data.
>
> We sell software. You pay money. We make it good. Simple.

## Example 5: Process

### Before (Agile Speak)

> Our development methodology incorporates agile principles with adaptations tailored to our organizational context. We utilize two-week sprints, daily standups, and regular retrospectives to maintain alignment and continuous improvement. Story pointing and velocity tracking enable predictable delivery cadence.

### After (DHH Style)

> **We don't do sprints. We do work.**
>
> No story points. No velocity tracking. No burndown charts.
>
> "But how do you know if you're on track?" We look at the work. Is it getting better? Are customers happier? Are we shipping?
>
> All that agile ceremony? It's a comfort blanket. It makes managers feel like they're managing. But you can't sprint your way to quality. You can't retro your way to good decisions.
>
> Here's our process: Figure out what matters. Do it. Ship it. Repeat.
>
> Revolutionary, I know.

## Example 6: Technology Choices

### Before (Tech Blog)

> When evaluating technology stack decisions, it's important to consider factors such as scalability, maintainability, talent availability, and alignment with organizational capabilities. While newer technologies may offer compelling features, mature solutions often provide better long-term stability and support ecosystems.

### After (DHH Style)

> **Choose boring technology.**
>
> That shiny new framework? Skip it.
>
> Rails shipped 20 years ago. Postgres has been around since Reagan. They work. They're boring. That's the point.
>
> Every new technology is a risk. You're betting that:
> 1. It'll still be maintained in 5 years
> 2. You can hire people who know it
> 3. The bugs have been found
>
> Boring technology has passed those tests. The new hotness hasn't.
>
> We still use Rails. We'll probably still use it in 2034. Innovation is overrated. Reliability isn't.

## The Transformation Checklist

When rewriting corporate content in DHH style:

1. **Cut the first paragraph** - The point usually starts in paragraph 2
2. **Remove all hedge words** - Find/replace for "might," "some," "generally"
3. **Shorten every sentence** - Target 15 words max
4. **Add a contrarian frame** - What does everyone assume? Challenge it
5. **End with a punch** - Quotable, memorable, shareable
6. **Make it personal** - What's your actual experience?
7. **Pick a side** - No "on the other hand"
