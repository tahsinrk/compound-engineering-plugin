# DHH Writing Anti-Patterns

Patterns to avoid when writing in the DHH style.

## The Seven Deadly Sins

### 1. The Hedge

**The Sin**: Qualifying everything so you can't be wrong.

**Example**:
> "In my experience, it seems like remote work might be beneficial for certain types of knowledge workers in some contexts, though individual results may vary."

**The Fix**: Commit. Be wrong sometimes. It's better than being boring.

> "Remote work is better. Full stop."

**Hedge words to eliminate**:
- "It seems like..."
- "In my experience..."
- "For some people..."
- "It depends..."
- "Generally speaking..."
- "More or less..."

### 2. The Both-Sides

**The Sin**: Presenting every argument as having two equally valid perspectives.

**Example**:
> "There are compelling arguments both for and against the traditional office environment. Some prefer the structure and social interaction, while others value the flexibility of remote work. Ultimately, each organization must find the approach that works best for their unique context."

**The Fix**: Pick a side. The reader came for your opinion.

> "Offices are obsolete. The companies that don't realize this will lose their best people to the ones that do."

### 3. The Disclaimer

**The Sin**: Pre-emptively apologizing for your position.

**Example**:
> "This is just my personal opinion, and I understand others may see it differently. I'm not saying my way is the only way, and of course your mileage may vary. That said, I think..."

**The Fix**: Everyone knows it's your opinion. It's your blog. Say what you mean.

### 4. The Corporate

**The Sin**: Using business-speak that means nothing.

**Examples**:
- "Synergize our value proposition"
- "Leverage our core competencies"
- "Drive alignment across stakeholders"
- "Enable a best-in-class customer experience"
- "Optimize our go-to-market strategy"

**The Fix**: Say what you're actually doing.

| Corporate | Human |
|-----------|-------|
| "Synergize" | "Combine" or "Work together" |
| "Leverage" | "Use" |
| "Stakeholders" | "People involved" or name them |
| "Core competencies" | "What we're good at" |
| "Value proposition" | "Why you should buy this" |

### 5. The Summary

**The Sin**: Ending with a recap no one asked for.

**Example**:
> "In conclusion, we have examined the various aspects of remote work, including its benefits such as flexibility and productivity, its challenges including communication and isolation, and strategies for successful implementation. As we have seen, there are many factors to consider when making this important decision."

**The Fix**: Your last line should add something new. Make it quotable.

> "The office is dead. Start acting like it."

### 6. The Question Cop-Out

**The Sin**: Ending with a question instead of a position.

**Example**:
> "So what do you think? Is remote work right for your organization? Sound off in the comments!"

**The Fix**: Answer your own questions. That's why readers came.

> "Is remote work right for your organization? Yes. Next question."

### 7. The Passive Epidemic

**The Sin**: Hiding actors and decisions behind passive constructions.

**Examples**:
- "It was decided that..."
- "Mistakes were made..."
- "The policy was implemented..."
- "It is believed that..."

**The Fix**: Name the actor. Take responsibility.

| Passive | Active |
|---------|--------|
| "It was decided that we would go remote" | "We decided to go remote" |
| "Mistakes were made" | "I made mistakes" |
| "The policy was implemented" | "We implemented the policy" |
| "It is believed that..." | "I believe..." or "Research shows..." |

## Quick Reference: Warning Signs

Your writing has slipped if you find:

| Warning Sign | Probable Sin |
|--------------|--------------|
| First paragraph has no thesis | The Hedge or Both-Sides |
| "I could be wrong, but..." | The Disclaimer |
| Three or more buzzwords | The Corporate |
| "In conclusion..." | The Summary |
| "What do you think?" ending | The Question Cop-Out |
| "It was" or "There are" | The Passive Epidemic |
| Every sentence over 20 words | All of the above |

## The DHH Test

Before publishing, ask:

1. **Would you bet money on this?** If not, strengthen your position.
2. **Could someone disagree?** If not, you haven't said anything.
3. **Is the last line tweetable?** If not, rewrite it.
4. **Did you use "synergy" unironically?** Delete it.
5. **Would DHH actually publish this?** Be honest with yourself.
