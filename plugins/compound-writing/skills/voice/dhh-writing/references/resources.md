## Style Elements to Study

### Sentence Structure

DHH's typical patterns:

**The Declaration**:
> "We don't have meetings."

**The Three-Beat**:
> "Build less. Charge more. Sleep better."

**The Reversal**:
> "Move fast and break things? How about move deliberately and build things that last?"

**The Question-Answer**:
> "What's the best meeting? The one you don't have."

### Paragraph Structure

Most DHH paragraphs follow:
1. Bold claim (1 sentence)
2. Brief elaboration (1-2 sentences)
3. Concrete example or evidence (1-2 sentences)

Total: 3-4 sentences max. Often 1-2.

### Post Structure

Typical DHH blog post:
1. **Hook**: Contrarian statement or strong opinion
2. **Context**: Why this matters now (brief)
3. **Thesis**: Clear statement of position
4. **Evidence**: Experience-based examples
5. **Objection handling**: Address counter-arguments
6. **Close**: Quotable conclusion

Word count: Usually 300-800 words. Rarely over 1000.

## Contrast Study

Understanding DHH's style by contrasting with others:

| Writer | Style | DHH Difference |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Paul Graham | Exploratory, building arguments | DHH arrives at conclusions faster |
| Seth Godin | Metaphorical, inspirational | DHH is more concrete, less abstract |
| Hacker News | Technical, qualified | DHH is opinionated, unhedged |
| Corporate blogs | Safe, buzzword-heavy | DHH is risky, plain-spoken |

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Conversion
Take a corporate announcement and rewrite it in DHH style.
- Cut word count by 60%
- Remove all hedge words
- Add a contrarian frame
- End with a strong line

### Exercise 2: The Thesis Test
Write 10 thesis statements. For each one, ask: "Could someone disagree?" If everyone would agree, it's too weak.

### Exercise 3: The Sentence Diet
Take a paragraph you've written. Target 12 words per sentence. Cut everything that doesn't need to be there.

### Exercise 4: The Callback
Write a blog post that opens with a question and ends by answering it decisively. The last line should be quotable.

## Quotes to Remember

> "I'm not particularly prescient. I just have a low tolerance for bullshit."

> "Startups don't die from running out of money. They die from running out of time."

> "The best way to predict the future is to build it. But only if you actually ship."

> "Meetings are toxic. They chop up the day into small bits."

> "Simple is good. Good is simple. Don't mistake complication for sophistication."

## Warning

The DHH style is powerful but risky:
- It's easy to be contrarian without being insightful
- Strong opinions require strong evidence
- Punchy doesn't mean aggressive
- The goal is clarity, not controversy

The best DHH-style writing is brave, not reckless. It takes positions because they're true, not because they're provocative.
