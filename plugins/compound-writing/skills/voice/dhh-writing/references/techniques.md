# DHH Writing Techniques

Extended guide to the 10 core techniques with detailed examples.

## 1. Take a Stand

### The Principle

Every piece needs a thesis statement that someone could reasonably disagree with. If everyone agrees, you haven't said anything.

### Examples

**Weak thesis**:
> "Code quality is important for long-term project success."

Who disagrees? No one. This is filler.

**Strong thesis**:
> "TDD is dead. Long live testing."

**Weak thesis**:
> "Companies should consider the benefits of work-life balance."

**Strong thesis**:
> "If your startup requires 80-hour weeks, you've failed at planning. Crunch is management failure, not dedication."

### How to Find Your Thesis

1. What do you believe that your peers would argue against?
2. What "best practice" have you seen fail?
3. What worked for you that the experts said wouldn't?
4. What pisses you off about your industry?

## 2. No Hedging

### Words to Eliminate

| Hedge | Replacement |
|-------|-------------|
| "I think" | [just state it] |
| "In my opinion" | [obviously your opinion] |
| "It seems like" | "It is" or "I've seen" |
| "Some might say" | "Critics say" or cut it |
| "Generally speaking" | "Usually" or be specific |
| "Basically" | [delete] |
| "Kind of" | [delete or be specific] |
| "Sort of" | [delete or be specific] |
| "Perhaps" | "Maybe" or commit |
| "Might" | "Will" or "Could" |

### Before/After

**Before**:
> "I think that, in my experience, remote work seems to generally improve productivity for some knowledge workers, at least in certain contexts."

**After**:
> "Remote work improves productivity. We've seen it at Basecamp for two decades."

## 3. Short Sentences

### The 15-Word Rule

Target average sentence length of 12-15 words. Vary for rhythm.

### Techniques

**Break up compound sentences**:

Before:
> "We believe that great software should be beautiful and functional, and that the best products come from small teams who care deeply about what they're building."

After:
> "Great software should be beautiful. It should be functional. The best products come from small teams. Teams who care about their work."

**Use fragments for emphasis**:

> "Remote work isn't the future. It's the present. Wake up."

**One idea per sentence**:

Before:
> "While there are certainly benefits to the traditional office environment, including spontaneous collaboration and the building of company culture, we've found that these can be replicated and even improved upon in a remote setting."

After:
> "Offices have benefits. Spontaneous collaboration. Culture building. But all of these work remotely too. Sometimes better."

## 4. Contrarian Framing

### The Pattern

1. State what "everyone knows"
2. Signal your disagreement
3. State your actual position
4. Support it

### Examples

**Tech Industry Contrarian**:
> "Move fast and break things." That was Facebook's motto.
>
> It's wrong.
>
> Move deliberately. Build things that last. Speed without durability is just churn.

**Business Contrarian**:
> "The customer is always right."
>
> No, they're not.
>
> Some customers are wrong for your business. Some requests would make your product worse. Know when to say no.

**Management Contrarian**:
> "Hire slow, fire fast."
>
> We don't.
>
> Fire slow. Give people a real chance. If you hired them, you owe them genuine effort before giving up.

## 5. Concrete Over Abstract

### The Test

Can someone take action based on what you wrote? If not, it's too abstract.

### Before/After

**Abstract**:
> "We believe in empowering our team members to achieve work-life integration through flexible policies."

**Concrete**:
> "Everyone gets Fridays off in summer. No questions. No make-up work. Just a three-day weekend."

**Abstract**:
> "Our compensation philosophy centers on providing competitive market-rate salaries."

**Concrete**:
> "We pay San Francisco rates to everyone, regardless of where they live. A senior developer makes $180k whether they're in SF or Tulsa."

## 6. The Rule of Three

### Why Three?

- One is a statement
- Two is a comparison
- Three is a pattern

### Examples

> "We don't do unlimited vacation. We don't do open offices. We don't do always-on Slack."

> "Build less. Charge more. Sleep well."

> "Good software takes time. It takes focus. It takes saying no."

### Pattern Variations

**Three beats, escalating**:
> "First, they ignore you. Then, they laugh at you. Then, you win."

**Three beats, parallel**:
> "We write to think. We write to teach. We write to learn."

**Three beats, reversal**:
> "More isn't better. Better is better. Often, less is better."

## 7. Moral Clarity

### Reframe Business as Ethics

Business decisions are often presented as purely practical. DHH reframes them as ethical choices.

**Practical framing**:
> "We found that remote work improved our productivity metrics."

**Ethical framing**:
> "Requiring people to commute two hours a day so managers can see butts in seats isn't a productivity strategy. It's a values statement. You're saying your need for control matters more than their time."

### Examples

**On Pricing**:
> "Race to the bottom pricing isn't just bad business. It's disrespectful to your employees. If you can't charge enough to pay well, you're subsidizing your customers with your team's labor."

**On Hiring**:
> "Hiring only from 'top schools' isn't just ineffective. It's lazy credentialism that perpetuates inequality while pretending to be merit-based."

## 8. The Callback Attack

### The Pattern

1. Acknowledge the strongest counter-argument
2. Show you understand it
3. Explain why it's still wrong

### Examples

**Remote Work**:
> "Yes, some conversations are better in person. Yes, whiteboarding has value. Yes, lunch together builds bonds.
>
> But if your company *requires* these things to function, you have a communication problem. You've built a culture that only works under ideal conditions. Real work happens in the gaps."

**Agile Criticism**:
> "Yes, agile was better than waterfall. Yes, iterating is better than big design up front. Yes, talking to customers matters.
>
> But somewhere we lost the plot. Two-week sprints became mandatory. Velocity became a metric. Retros became rituals. The manifesto that rejected process became... process."

## 9. End Strong

### The Test

Could your last line be a tweet? Could it be a book title? Could someone quote it?

### Techniques

**The Declaration**:
> "Remote is not the future of work. It's the present. Everyone else is just catching up."

**The Challenge**:
> "Stop asking for permission. Start building what matters."

**The Reversal**:
> "The best meetings are the ones you don't have."

**The Warning**:
> "The companies that don't adapt won't disappear. They'll just slowly become irrelevant."

### Anti-Patterns

Don't end with:
- Summaries ("In conclusion...")
- Hedges ("But of course, this is just one perspective...")
- Questions without answers ("What do you think?")
- Calls to comment ("Let me know in the comments!")

## 10. Personal Stakes

### Show Skin in the Game

Readers trust advice more when you've taken the risk.

### Examples

**Experience-based**:
> "This isn't theory. We've run Basecamp remotely for 20 years, through two recessions and a pandemic. It works."

**Admission-based**:
> "I know this because I used to be wrong. We used to have an office. We used to think face time mattered. We were idiots."

**Risk-based**:
> "We turned down $100 million in funding to keep the company ours. Was it the right call? Ask me in another decade."
