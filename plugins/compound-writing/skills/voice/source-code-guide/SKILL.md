# Source Code Style Guide

Source Code is Every's series on the craft of building in the AI era. These essays document, define, and brand new ways of working—not just with code, but with design, product philosophy, and the entire creative process of making software.

## Vision

**We coin language, demonstrate workflows, and shape how the industry thinks about building with AI.**

Our purpose:
- Establish Source Code as the cultural and technical reference for AI-native creation
- Coin and circulate the vocabulary that defines new disciplines (compounding engineering, vibe design, selfish software)
- Transform Every's practices into public intellectual property: frameworks, metaphors, and playbooks

## Part 1: The Source Code Gradient

Not every piece needs to be purely technical. We publish across a spectrum:

| Type | Focus | Examples |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Engineering-Heavy** | Deep technical workflows, system architecture, code-first narratives | Claude Code delegation, parallel orchestration |
| **Practice-Focused** | New methodologies, workflow innovations, tool orchestration | Compounding engineering, vibe coding |
| **Philosophy-Driven** | Design as engineering, personal software manifestos, ethics/aesthetics | Atmosphere-first development, selfish software |
| **Journey-Centered** | Career transformation, origin stories, personal cost and reward | Finding your way back to what you love |

**All are valid Source Code pieces if they illuminate new ways of building in the AI age.**

---

## Part 2: Strategy Principles

### 1. Anchor in First-Person Authority

Source Code is written by the builders themselves: Kieran Klaassen on Claude Code and compounding engineering, Yash Poojary on Sparkle's rebuild, Lucas on design philosophy.

**Tone:** Personal but authoritative—"field notes" from people shipping real products.

### 2. Personal Stakes as Foundation

Every piece needs to show what the author risks or sacrifices:

| Stake Type | Example |
|------------|---------|
| **Origin stories** | Why you started building this way |
| **Rediscovery narratives** | Finding your way back to what you love |
| **Career pivots** | When conventional success isn't enough |
| **The cost of the practice** | Late nights, failed experiments, $100 fines |

**Stakes make the practice real, not theoretical.**

### 3. The "One Big Idea" Rule

Each piece must coin, claim, or crystallize ONE memorable concept:

- A new discipline (compounding engineering)
- A practice philosophy (vibe design, selfish software)
- A controversial stance (AI wrappers are the future)
- A workflow innovation (parallel Claude orchestration)

**This builds Every's intellectual property one term at a time.**

### 4. Blend Narrative with Intellectual Rigor

1. **Open with a scene:** PRs reviewing themselves, a weekend rebuild of Sparkle, a debugging breakthrough
2. **Zoom out to the universal:** How engineering work, careers, or creativity itself are changing
3. **Ground in data or stakes:** Sparkle has organized 10M+ files; compounding engineering cuts ship times from weeks to days

### 5. Build Playbooks, Not Just Opinions

Every piece delivers frameworks and heuristics readers can try. Playbooks come in many forms:

| Playbook Type | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Technical frameworks** | Commands, workflows, step-by-step processes |
| **Philosophical principles** | Mindset shifts and new ways of thinking |
| **Tool stacks** | Specific setup and why it matters |
| **Challenges/Provocations** | "Start your experiment log today" |
| **Visual systems** | Atmosphere kits, VIBE.md files |

**Not every piece needs explicit steps, but all should leave readers with something actionable.**

### 6. The ELI5 Rule

Our pieces must be specific enough to be interesting to an advanced AI user AND descriptive enough to be accessible to a smart newcomer.

**When to apply:**
- Using a technical term or tool name for the first time
- Describing how we built or tested something
- Explaining an editing, research, or publishing workflow
- Recounting "how I got from A → B" in an anecdote

#### Examples that BREAK the ELI5 rule

❌ **Vague workflow:**
> "We spun up a retrieval pipeline with subagents, chunked the corpus, hydrated the cache, and it just worked."

Why it breaks: Jargon, no steps, missing clicks/inputs.

❌ **Hand-wavy editing:**
> "I ran the draft through our editor, then tuned it until it felt right."

Why it breaks: No start state, no actions, no success check.

❌ **A → B without the bridge:**
> "I started with a messy free write and ended with a clean memo. I played around until the ideas clicked."

Why it breaks: Skips the actual moves that made the change.

#### Examples that FOLLOW the ELI5 rule

| Term | ELI5 Explanation |
|------|------------------|
| Agent vs. slash command | "An agent (a specialized AI worker) versus a slash command (a simple shortcut)" |
| Context window | "Each agent has its own separate conversation history and memory, so they can't see each other's work unless you pass it along" |
| Prompt engineering | "The process of designing laser-specific prompts so large language models produce the output you want" |
| Context engineering | "Prompt engineering is asking your brilliant intern the right question. Context engineering is giving that intern access to the right filing cabinets… and examples of what 'good' looks like" |
| Vibe coding | "Coding with AI-powered tools that convert natural-language instructions into working code" |
| Bridge job | "Roles that appear when a new technology needs human translators—essential at first, then absorbed once the interface gets easier" |

---

## Part 3: Sensibility

Source Code inherits Every's tonal DNA:

| Quality | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| **Optimistic Realism** | AI as leverage, with quirks surfaced (Claude over-testing, Gemini over-engineering) |
| **Practical Optimism** | Constructive frameworks, not contrarian rants |
| **Personal Stakes** | Exhaustion, late-night ramen rebuilds, nitpicky "feel checks" |
| **Accessible Rigor** | Technical enough for engineers, clear enough for curious non-tech readers |
| **Taste as Core Value** | Coding isn't just implementation—it's about "sparkle," vibe, and design choices |

### Voice Spectrum

Different pieces call for different voices, all valid:

| Voice | Example Line |
|-------|--------------|
| **Technical authority** | "I haven't typed a function in weeks, yet I'm shipping faster than ever" |
| **Philosophical builder** | "Software is a place; make it worth visiting" |
| **Vulnerable founder** | "The questions still haunt me sometimes" |
| **Rediscovered enthusiast** | "Code was like magic, but better—it was real" |
| **Defiant craftsperson** | "You don't need permission to make the internet beautiful" |

**Choose the voice that serves the story.**

## Part 4: Craft Checklist

### Opening Patterns

Start strong with one of these proven patterns:

#### The Charged Anecdote
- "The PR that reviewed itself"
- "Opening email and flinching at the fluorescent void"
- "Seeing your design aesthetic stolen"

#### The Manifesto Declaration
- "I'd like to introduce a concept I call selfish software"
- "Software should conform to you, not the other way around"

#### The Sensory Contrast
- Fluorescent Gmail vs. outside air
- Conference room software vs. somewhere you want to be

#### The Confession
- "Two months ago, I chose chaos over comfort"
- "I haven't typed a function in weeks"

#### The Pattern Recognition
- Multiple Claude instances like mission control
- Your feed full of your work—except it isn't

### Throughout the Piece

**Mix registers and materials:**
- Technical exposition + personal narrative
- Code/prompts/screenshots + human reflection
- Philosophy + practical application
- Data/metrics + sensory details

**Use concrete language:**

| ❌ Vague | ✅ Concrete |
|----------|-------------|
| "Optimized workflows" | "Claude spun up five PRs while I drank coffee" |
| "Enhanced backgrounds" | "8k oil-painted skies" |
| "Cost-effective" | "$400/month replacing $400k/year" |

**Create memorable subheads:**
Not just organizational but evocative:
- "The Gravity of Sameness"
- "Escaping the Golden Handcuffs"
- "Ship the Atmosphere"

**Address the skeptics:**

| Objection | Response Pattern |
|-----------|------------------|
| "Ugly products win" | Sometimes, but... |
| "We can't afford this" | You can't afford not to |
| "AI wrappers are overdone" | The opportunity is just beginning |

## Part 6: Source Code Commandments

1. **Show the mess** — Include failures, frustrations, and false starts
2. **Coin deliberately** — If you name it, define it clearly and defend it
3. **Connect to canon** — Reference other Source Code concepts where relevant
4. **Start from joy** — Even technical pieces should convey enthusiasm
5. **End with action** — Give readers something specific to try
6. **Prove with examples** — Show actual workflows, real metrics, screenshots
7. **Write the future** — Describe the world where this practice is normal
8. **Honor the craft** — Respect both technical excellence and human creativity
9. **Make it memorable** — One takeaway phrase or framework they'll quote
10. **Build in public** — Share tools, frameworks, and code where possible

---

## Why It Matters

Source Code is Every's claim on the future of building. In a world where:
- AI can generate competent code in seconds
- Templates and patterns are free
- Technical barriers are falling daily

...the differentiators become:
- **Taste and curation**
- **Joy and personal connection**
- **Systems that compound**
- **Philosophy that guides practice**
- **Character that can't be averaged away**

Source Code documents the builders who understand this shift and are creating the disciplines, tools, and mindsets for what comes next.
