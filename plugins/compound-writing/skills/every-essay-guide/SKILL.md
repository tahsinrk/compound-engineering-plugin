## Part 1: What Makes an Every Essay

### 1. Optimistic Realism About AI and Work

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Practical optimism** | AI is treated as an enabling force—but never a silver bullet. Celebrate possibilities while naming risks. |
| **From knowledge to allocation** | Track the macro-shift: raw knowledge matters less than the judgment to wield AI-generated intelligence. |
| **Rise of the generalist** | Champion adaptable people who synthesize across domains and thrive in "wicked" environments—work that remains stubbornly human. |

### 2. Personal Narrative × Intellectual Rigor

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Intellectual accessibility** | Translate dense economic or philosophical ideas into plain, lively language. |
| **Narrative-driven argument** | A vivid anecdote or scene pulls readers in before zooming to universal insight. |
| **Authenticity and vulnerability** | Disclose a personal stake—mental health, career pivots, creative doubts—to make abstract forces visceral. |

### 3. Rethinking Creativity and Entrepreneurship

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Writing as product R&D** | Essays seed software, courses, and consulting—proving ideas in public before building. |
| **Audience-first business model** | Subscriptions and spin-off services fund exploration, aligning incentives with reader trust rather than VC timelines. |
| **Constant experimentation** | Pivot quickly with algorithm shifts, AI advances, and new formats—treating agility as a craft. |

### 4. Practical Optimism & Generous Intellectualism

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Constructive, not contrarian** | Critique, then propose frameworks, metaphors, or playbooks that move the conversation forward. |
| **Open-ended curiosity** | Pose genuine questions and invite readers into the search, resisting dogma. |

### 5. Interconnected, Recursive Thinking

Ideas recur and evolve ("allocation economy," "vibe coding"), weaving a self-referential, cumulative universe that rewards long-time readers.

## Part 2: Every Writing Best Practices

Ten craft principles that keep essays sharp, honest, and actionable:

### 1. Hook & Purpose
Lead with tension; state the promise fast. The reader should feel the problem and crave the answer within two sentences.

### 2. Structure & Flow
Each section answers the question you just posed. Clear progression, no wandering.

### 3. Depth Over Breadth
Fewer ideas, interrogated harder. Own one thing completely rather than touching many things lightly.

### 4. Facts Before Feelings
Evidence first, emotion second. Ground claims in data, examples, or expert voices before making emotional appeals.

### 5. Concrete, Sensory Writing
Make abstractions photographable. Can you film the nouns and verbs?

**Weak:** "The company grew quickly."
**Strong:** "Headcount jumped from 12 to 47 in six months."

### 6. Confident, Nuanced Claims
Assert boldly, qualify intelligently. Own your perspective while acknowledging complexity.

### 7. Rhythm & Voice
Vary sentence length; surface your stake early. Read aloud—does it have music?

### 8. Dialogue & Interiority
Trim dialogue tags; earn emotional beats. Show thought in action.

### 9. One-and-Done Statements
No echoing. Say it once, say it best. If you've made the point, move on.

### 10. Payoff & Practicality
End with actions, frameworks, or reframed vision. The reader leaves able to do, see differently, or quote something.

## Part 3: Hed / Dek / Opening Paragraph Playbook

A great Every piece wins or loses readers in the first 150 words. Use this three-step method:

### Step 1: Find the Spark

1. Speed-read your draft; stop where your own heartbeat jumps.
2. The sentence that startles you—that's the core idea. Highlight it.

### Step 2: Put the Spark on Top

#### Hed (Headline)
State the idea in its punchiest, most concrete form. Avoid abstractions; invoke stakes.

| Weak | Stronger |
|------|----------|
| "Redesign Everything for AI" | "Redesign the Web for a Billion AI Agents" |
| "How to Be More Productive" | "The 90-Minute Rule That Saved My Startup" |

#### Dek (Sub-headline)
Sharpen the promise—who benefits, what's at stake, why now. Keep it one crisp line.

> "There's a fortune to be made if you can build interfaces AI can read."

#### Opening Paragraph

1. **Meet the reader where they are.** Pose or restate the question your hed opened.
2. **Set the stakes.** Make the problem visceral (money, time, reputation, existential dread).
3. **Establish credibility.** One line on why you can guide them.
4. **Promise the payoff.** What will they know or be able to do by the end?

### Step 3: Stress-Test Before Shipping

- [ ] Would a skim-reader feel the problem and crave the answer after two sentences?
- [ ] Is the hed specific enough that someone could argue with it? (If not, get sharper.)
- [ ] Could the dek double as a tweet people might quote?

## Part 4: Pre-Share Checklist

Eight quick scans that catch 90% of problems before editors do:

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Promise check** | Does the opener state the tension and hint at payoff? |
| **Evidence check** | Are bold claims supported by data, examples, or experts? |
| **Camera check** | Can you film the nouns and verbs? |
| **Hedge check** | Delete unnecessary qualifiers. |
| **Music check** | Read aloud; vary the beat. |
| **POV check** | Is your stake visible by word 150? |
| **Transition check** | Does each section answer "why now?" |
| **Payoff check** | Will the reader leave able to do, see differently, or quote something? |

## Summary: Takeaways for Writers

1. **Blend personal + universal.** Start from lived experience; expand to cultural or economic stakes.

2. **Maintain practical optimism.** Critique tech responsibly, but spotlight creative possibilities.

3. **Celebrate synthesis.** Show how cross-domain thinking beats narrow specialization.

4. **Stay accessible.** Explain big theories in everyday language and examples.

5. **Move with the internet.** Iterate, experiment, update. Curiosity is a workflow, not a one-off.
